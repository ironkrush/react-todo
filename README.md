Hey there!
This is a simple yet fun to-do list app I built using Next.js and React.js! I'm showcasing it to demonstrate my skills and passion for web development.

What it does:

Create, manage, and mark to-do items.
Keep track of your tasks in a clean and organized interface.
Feel the satisfaction of checking things off your list! âœ…
Built with:

Next.js: A powerful framework for building fast and SEO-friendly React applications.
React.js: A popular JavaScript library for creating dynamic and user-friendly interfaces.
Why I built it:

I wanted to create a practical application using the skills I've learned.
I enjoy the challenge of building something functional and visually appealing.
I believe good organization is key to productivity, and this app helps me stay on top of things!
Check it out!

This app is currently deployed on Vercel, so you can see it in action here: https://react-todo-steel-two.vercel.app/

I'm still learning and growing as a developer, but I'm excited to share this project and welcome any feedback!

P.S. This is just a basic example, but I'm eager to tackle more complex projects in the future.
